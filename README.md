## Information

- Squircletopia is a topdown RPG with turn-based combat where the village of Squircles must settle their differences with four hostile factions. Or destory them. Whatever works.
- Controls: WASD or Arrow Keys to move; Shift to sprint. Click with the mouse or use Spacebar or Enter to interact with nearby objects.
- The game is a work in progress and is missing several planned features: For example the ability shop, being able to use items or flee in battles and the "Instructions" in the main menu.
- This game uses several free-to-use assets. A credit list will be added in the future.

### Known Bugs

- Battle music can on rare occasion overlap with the regular music
- Enemies that are "pacified" will remain so upon saving, but their color will not.
